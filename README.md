The TameableEnderman Mod makes Endermen Tameable!

Tame Endermen by giving them Popped Chorus Fruit (right-click). You can feed and heal Endermen with chorus fruit and apples. Apples heal by 5hp and Chorus fruit by 10hp.

Right-clicking a tamed Enderman with an empty hand will switch between standing, follow, and wander.

They will not wander outside a 16 block radius

Tamed Endermen will put themselves in wander mode and attempt to walk back to where they were last right-clicked whenever they teleport (example: they touch water, sometimes when they take damage, etc...).

Tamed Endermen do NOT de-spawn AND will not disappear on peaceful (no name tag needed, but still recommend for identification). (and, yes, normal endermen do still despawn)

Tamed Endermen will not take damage from rain and will not hide from the sun.

Tamed Endermen are peaceful so you don't have to worry about accidently hitting them or looking at them in the eye.

Note: They will not defend you, even if you are being attacked

Right-Clicking a tamed Enderman with a feather will toggle silenced on or off (they can be quite loud at times)

Do note that, like wolves, only the "owner" can toggle between standing, following, and wandering. No kidnapping Endermen

I do NOT know if it works with mods that add pet beds or pet respawn mechanics, TEST ON CREATIVE BEFORE RISKING YOUR ENDERFRIEND'S LIFE!!!!
