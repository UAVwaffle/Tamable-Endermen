The TameableEnderman Mod makes Endermen Tamable!

Tame Endermen by giving them a chorus flower (right-click).
You can feed Endermen chorus fruit, apples, golden apples, and enchanted golden apples.

Right-click tamed Endermen with an empty hand to toggle between sit*, follow, and wander**.
*sit is really just stand still.
**wander stays within a 16 block radius where they were last right-clicked.

Tamed Endermen will put themselves in wander mode and attempt to walk back to where they were last right-clicked when they teleport (example: they touch water, it's raining, the sun is shining on them, they take damage, etc...).

Tamed Endermen do NOT de-spawn AND will not disappear on peaceful (no name tag needed, but still recommend for identification). (and, yes, normal endermen do still despawn)

Tamed Endermen are peaceful to their "friend", miner who gave them a chorus flower, kind of like wolves, but do not defend their friend/owner unlike wolves.

idk if it works with mods that add pet bed or pet respawn mechanics, TEST ON CREATIVE BEFORE RISKING YOUR ENDERFRIEND'S LIFE!!!!
