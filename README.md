The TameableEnderman Mod makes Endermen Tameable!



Tame Endermen by giving them Popped Chorus Fruit (right-click). You can feed and heal Endermen with chorus fruit and apples. _Apples heal by 5hp and Chorus fruit by 10hp._



Right-clicking a tamed Enderman with an empty hand will switch between standing, following, and wandering.

_They will not wander outside a 16-block radius_



If your Enderman gets hurt and randomly teleports, it will put itself in wander mode and, if it's not too far away, attempt to walk to its last "right-click position".

Tamed Endermen do NOT despawn AND will not disappear on peaceful _(no name tag needed, but still recommended for identification). (and, yes, normal endermen do still despawn)_



Tamed Endermen will not take damage from rain and will not hide from the sun.

Tamed Endermen are peaceful, so you don't have to worry about accidentally hitting them or looking them in the eye.

_Note: They will not defend you, even if you are being attacked_



Right-clicking a tamed Enderman with a feather will toggle silenced on or off (they can be quite loud at times)



_More notes! Like wolves, only the "owner" can toggle between standing, following, and wandering. No kidnapping Endermen!!_

I do NOT know if this mod's taming mechanics work with mods that add pet beds or pet respawn mechanics, TEST ON CREATIVE BEFORE RISKING YOUR ENDERFRIEND'S LIFE!!!!
